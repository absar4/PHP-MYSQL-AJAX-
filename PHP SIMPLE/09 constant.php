<!-- PHP Constants
Constants are like variables except that once they are defined they cannot be changed or undefined.

PHP Constants
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.

A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).

Note: Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.

Create a PHP Constant
To create a constant, use the define() function.

Syntax
define(name, value, case-insensitive)
Parameters:

name: Specifies the name of the constant
value: Specifies the value of the constant
case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false
Example
Create a constant with a case-sensitive name: -->

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");
echo GREETING;
?>
Example
Create a constant with a case-insensitive name:

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!", true);
echo greeting;
?>


<!-- Constants are Global
Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

Example
This example uses a constant inside a function, even if it is defined outside the function: -->

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");

function myTest() {
  echo GREETING;
}
 
myTest();
?>
