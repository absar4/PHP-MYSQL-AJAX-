What is a PHP File?
PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code
PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML
PHP files have extension ".php"

Basic PHP Syntax
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:

<?php
// PHP code goes here
echo "Hello World!";
?>
The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".



its not case sensitive so all of these three are legal to use but we'll be dealing with lower case most of the time
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
