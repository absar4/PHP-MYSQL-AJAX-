An array stores multiple values in one single variable:

Example
<?php
$fruits = array("apple", "mange", "cherry");
echo "I love to eat " . $cars[0] . ", " . $cars[1] . " and " . $cars[2] . ".";
?>


In PHP, there are three types of arrays:

Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays
