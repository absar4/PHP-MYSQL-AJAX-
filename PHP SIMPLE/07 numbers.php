    PHP INTEGER: 
    An integer is a number without any decimal part.

An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 2147483647 in 32 bit systems, and between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.

Note: Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).

Here are some rules for integers:

An integer must have at least one digit
An integer must NOT have a decimal point
An integer can be either positive or negative
Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)
PHP has the following predefined constants for integers:

PHP_INT_MAX - The largest integer supported
PHP_INT_MIN - The smallest integer supported
PHP_INT_SIZE -  The size of an integer in bytes
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:

is_int()
is_integer() - alias of is_int()
is_long() - alias of is_int()
Example
Check if the type of a variable is integer: -->

<?php
$x = 5985;
var_dump(is_int($x));

$x = 59.85;
var_dump(is_int($x));
?>

    PHP Floats
A float is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.

2.0, 256.4, 10.358, 7.64E+5, 5.56E-5 are all floats.

The float data type can commonly store a value up to 1.7976931348623E+308 (platform dependent), and have a maximum precision of 14 digits.

PHP has the following predefined constants for floats (from PHP 7.2):

PHP_FLOAT_MAX - The largest representable floating point number
PHP_FLOAT_MIN - The smallest representable positive floating point number
- PHP_FLOAT_MAX - The smallest representable negative floating point number
PHP_FLOAT_DIG - The number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a float and back without precision loss
PHP_FLOAT_EPSILON - The smallest representable positive number x, so that x + 1.0 != 1.0
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is float:

is_float()
is_double() - alias of is_float()
Example
Check if the type of a variable is float: -->

<?php
$x = 10.365;
var_dump(is_float($x));
?>


PHP Casting Strings and Floats to Integers
Sometimes you need to cast a numerical value into another data type.

The (int) function are often used to convert a value to an integer.

Example
Cast float and string to integer:

<?php
// Cast float to int
$x = 23465.768;
$int_cast = (int)$x;
echo $int_cast;

echo "<br>";

// Cast string to int
$x = "23465.768";
$int_cast = (int)$x;
echo $int_cast;
?>
