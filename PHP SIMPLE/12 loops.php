<!-- PHP Loops -->
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

In PHP, we have the following loop types:

1. while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
2. do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
3. for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
4. foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array

while loop

syntax
while (condition is true) {
code to be executed;
}


<?php
$x = 1;

while($x <= 5) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>
