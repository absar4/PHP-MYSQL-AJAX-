Indexes is just a feature that will hel you to search much much faster
Like You have a topic you are looking for so you dont have to go through all the book but you have to read the indexes instead and point out what is realated to your to your topic then you can read that.... and this is much much faster than going through all the book 

Similarly, there are indexs in SQL Database that will work on back side but make your searches much faster 

let's say you have to search by title and you have many titles that are same so when you run a query without applying indexes like 
SELECT * FROM  `article` WHERE title = 'first post'
then if you have 100s or even 1000s of records  then you can see that the search is very slow


So now to avoid this problem we are gonna use indexes
Follow the Steps
1. Click on Structure tab
2. Scroll down and click on `Create an index on 1 columns [GO]`
3. You can add index name if you want or leave it blank
4. Now set index choice `index`
5. then select column as `title` and click on GO


Now you can use 
SELECT * FROM  `article` WHERE title = 'first post' 

=======================
ORDER in SQL

SELECT * FROM  `article` ORDER BY title(column name)
it will order data alphabatically 

You can also use 
SELECT * FROM  `article` ORDER BY title(column name) DESC
it will order data alphabatically  but in inverse of desending then there we use DESC keyword
